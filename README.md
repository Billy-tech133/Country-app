# Resources:

- The application design was gotten from front end mentor;
- material ui;

# Technologies Used:

- React(as the main javascript libary) with react context api, react-router-dom, and a great deal of react hooks.
- styled-components(for styling),

# Some Best practices:

Though the site is not as at best, here are some measures taken to make sure the site is as resposive and dynamic as posible.

- Firstly, the site was developed with react which is a very powerfull javascript libary used for building user interfaces.
- React context api was used as the data layer, to prevent prop-drilling and state management.
- React hooks use for state management examples used in this case are useEffect, useState, useRef, useCallBack, and useParams from the react router dom api.
- axios was used to get data from https://restcountries.eu via api,
- material ui icons was used to get icons used for this particular project.
- styled components was used to styled this project. flex box and grid where used to make the project as responsive and dynamic as possible.

The website is a demonstration of my front end skills and functionality was not 100% implemented, I might be returning anytime to complete the project.
